# API Response Structure

- Because the API has limits, it'd be great to have the response structure handy. I couldn't test the flow with the API once, but luckily, I saw the response structure for all APIs at least once.

# Boilerplate Enhancements

- It'd be great if the boilerplate included icons, images, and color codes.

# User Flow Description

- Besides design, it'd be helpful if we have textual description of user flow.
